PDFCreator

Creates a PDF/A file from a list of images. This code is used by
Ghent University Library to create PDF files out of TIF scans from
old manuscripts.

Usage:

  cd dist

  # Create a PDF out of a list of images
  ./pdfcreator -v -o test.pdf /tmp/*.tif

  # Create a PDF using a batch input
  ./pdfcreator -v -b -i ".*tif" -e ".*pdf" < input.txt

  where input.txt is a space delimited file containing an output file
  and an source image directory for every line.

  E.g.

  my_file.pdf  /data/files/my_images
  my_file2.pdf /data/files/my_images2


Options:

  -v  verbose
  -b  batch
  -o  output file
  -p  maximum number of pixels on either axis
