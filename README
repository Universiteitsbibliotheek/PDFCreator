PDFCreator

Creates a PDF/A file from a list of images. This code is used by
Ghent University Library to create PDF files out of TIFF scans.

Usage:

  cd dist

  # Create a PDF out of a list of images
  ./pdfcreator -v -o test.pdf /tmp/*.tif

  # Create a PDF using a batch input
  ./pdfcreator -v -b -i ".*tif" -e ".*pdf" < input.txt

  where input.txt is a space delimited file containing an output file
  and an source image directory for every line.

  E.g.

  my_file.pdf  /data/files/my_images
  my_file2.pdf /data/files/my_images2

Options:

  -v           - verbose
  -a 1A|1B|2A|2B|3A|3B|NONE   - PDF/A compliance
  -b           - batchmode
  -i regex     - include files [batchmode]
  -e regex     - exclude files [batchmode]
  -o file      - output file
  -t title     - title of the document
  -x version   - PDF verson ("1.4" -> "1.7")

Remarks:

  By default PDFCreator will generate a PDF/A-1B file that fills an area specified
by the image resolution tags. 

  By default PDFCreator will read the ICC Color profile from the supplied images.
If no color profile is provided sRGB will be used as default.
